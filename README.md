Here is a programming project in C that aims to implement the Patricia-Tries and Hybrid Tries. The tries is a data structure that is used to represent a dictionary of words.

This project uses the [Unity](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity.git) unit test framework for C as well as
[cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON.git) for the handling of JSON. These dependencies are integrated to the
project via git submodules so don't forget to fetch them when cloning as explained further below.

The online documentation for this project is hosted by GitHub Pages and is found at this address <https://greengageplum.github.io/tries/>. It is automatically built during each release using GitHub Actions.

## Authors

This programming project was carried out for the ALGAV (Advanced Algorithmics) class of the Computer Science Master's first year, first semester (M1S1 2024/25) at Sorbonne Universit√© by the following two fellow gentlemen.

* Efe ERKEN 21400542
* Deniz Ali DURBIN 21111116

## gcc/clang versions

"GNU gcc" and "Apple clang" are used as compilers. Right below are the versions of these compilers that were used:

```text
Apple clang version 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.3)

gcc-14 (Homebrew GCC 14.2.0_1) 14.2.0

Homebrew clang version 19.1.2
```

## Usage

### How to compile and execute?

First, install the dependencies with your package manager (apt, dnf, apk, brew, etc.): `gcc` (GNU C toolchain), `make`.

Then download the project on your machine via `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

Once that's done, go to the project directory and compile.

```sh
cd tries/

make
```

From now on you can execute the file so long as you're in its directory.

```sh
./tries
```

### Generate the documentation

First, install the dependencies with your package manager (apt, dnf, apk, brew, etc.): `doxygen`, `graphviz`.

To generate the documentation for your copy of the program, use the following command and take a look at the file `doc/public/index.html` in your favorite web browser.

```sh
make doc
```

Or else, you could see the [online documentation](https://greengageplum.github.io/tries/) for the latest version.

### How to clean?

To clean the project directory to start from zero there are multiple useful commands.

Remove all compilation files (`*.o`, `*.d`, final executable). This is to be done especially if you're changing the options of `gcc` (like adding `-g` for debugging).

```sh
make clean
```

Remove the documentation and its directories

```sh
make cleandoc
```

This is a command that groups together all that came before. It removes all the compilation, documentation and archive files and directories.

```sh
make cleanall
```

### Development environment

To have a developer environment for this projet to develop locally or to make contributions, follow the past instructions to get the source code and install the dependencies.
